# The Kobiton plugin for XebiaLabs XL Release product

Kobiton plugin helps users to run automation test on Kobiton devices, remotely and automatically from XL Release platform. Kobiton plugin can apply for uses:
- Users indie using Kobiton services
- User hosting a private server
- On-Premises

For the current version, Kobiton plugin just supports executing test through tasks in a **Release** job in XL Release.

## Featured tasks
From the plugin, we provided features to execute automation test easier:
- Get list available devices: Filter and fetch data of devices that users can access in Kobiton
- Request execute test: Request and execute test on provided devices data and test script in Kobiton system
- Wait for execution: Fetch result and log from the requested test

## Preparation
### A. Getting Kobiton Username and API key
Kobiton Username and API key are required for authenticating with Kobiton System to executing a test.

> If you don't have a Kobiton account, visit https://portal.kobiton.com/register to create one.

To get your Kobiton Username and API Key, please follow instructions at `IV. Configure Test Script for Kobiton` section on [our blog](https://kobiton.com/blog/tutorial/parallel-testing-selenium-webdriver/)

### B. Getting SSH key for the private repository

For executing a test, Kobiton plugin requires test script to be stored in **git** repository and Kobiton must have permission to access and clone the script to local for executing.

> Note: All of your private information such as test scripts, ssh key, etc. will be deleted after processing is completed.

- **For user using test script in public repository**: Use the HTTP link directly to the git input field (we will show in the `**request executing test** task)

- **For user using test script in private repository**: Kobiton requires a **ssh key** (private key) to authenticate with git.

    - The ssh key must be authenticated with git repository and it should not contain passphrase.
    > If you do not know how to authenticate the key with git, please follow the guide from [Github create SSH key instruction](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/) and [Github adding the key to account instruction](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/)

### B. Kobiton plugin tasks

![release](./readme/release.png)

*  In each release we will see the phase widget in the release. Choose __> Add task > Manual > Kobiton__ and you will see all the Kobiton plugin there.

The full detail of the plugin will show in the below sessions.
Kobiton Plugin now supports 3 tasks on XL Release environment:

#### 1. List Available Devices
This task will help to fetch all available (online) devices data that the user can access. The data can pass as the environment for other tasks to be consumed.

<img src="./readme/listdevices1.png" alt="listdevices1" width="600">

* **Input properties**:

| Field | Required | Type | Description |
| ----- | -------- | ---- |----------- |
|Favorite/In-house/Cloud Devices| Yes | Checkbox | The group containing devices that you want to use for automation test.<br> Note: You must choose at least 1 of these 3 options. |
|Android/iOS Devices| Yes | Checkbox | Mobile device OS that you want to get list. <br>Note: you must choose at least 1 of these 2 options. |

For more details of **Custom Params**, we can select specific devices properties such as device name, device model, device udid, etc.
Take an example, we want to select only **Galaxy S8** devices, we can specify in the field as:

![custom  params](./readme/customparams1.png)

* **Output properties**: If you want to use the output from this task to the next task, you need to create a variable to save the list of devices.

> Note: please choose some specific devices by using custom params. Because the next task will pick all devices in this output to execute test one by one.

| Step | Image |
| ---- | ----- |
| Type in textbox the variable's name you want to save | ![output list](./readme/outputlist0.png) |
| Click at the row below `${} Create a new varaible of type key-value map` to create varaible |  ![output list](./readme/outputlist1.png) |
| Result | ![output list](./readme/outputlist2.png) |

When properties are filled, update your task's information as you need: start date, due date, assignees, watchers, etc.

Finally, you just close the task window, it will autosave.
